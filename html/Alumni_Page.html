        <h5><strong>Alumni Association</strong></h5><br>
        The Asia-Pacific Alumni Association (AAA) offers an opportunity to our alumni to remain in touch with their alma mater. They are the Brand Ambassadors of Asia-Pacific Institute of Management and its most powerful communication channel to the outside world. As they come back repeatedly for a 360 sharing of experiences with their seniors, juniors, batch-mates and faculty, they bring in the latest trends and happenings from the corporate world.
        <br><br>
        They take back with them the latest knowledge from academia along with renewed memories, and through word-of-mouth enthuse more corporates to recruit Asia-Pacific graduates. All graduating students automatically become life-members of the AAA. The Alumni Affairs Committee takes care of the activities, under the close supervision of the CCR.

Nostalgia provides a wonderful opportunity to rekindle old memories amongst the alumni, re-calling the heydays at AIM and bringing the AIM community of Alumni, Students and Faculty members, together. Going forward, we will be institutionalizing more initiatives, in order to bring AIM and alumni together."
