              <p id="ifd">Dr.EmmyIndrayani, Vice-Dean, Gunadarma University, Jakarta, - delivered a guest lecture atAsia-Pacific Institute of management on 7th Jan., 2015, on "How to Build Brand Loyalty of New Technology Products and Services".

              Brand Loyalty, when it comes to New Technology Products and Services, is very important to address. Beyond global economic conditions, there’s an even bigger culprit leading to the decline in brand loyalty. Fast innovations in consumer technology have provided consumers with new tools for discovering, comparing, selecting and experiencing brands. Armed with these technological tools, customers are becoming increasingly brand agnostic.......check how interested the students are to listen on the topic and find solution of the problem! .
