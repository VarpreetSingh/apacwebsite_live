              <p id="ifn11"> Mr. Pankaj Dubey</p>
              </div>
              <p id="ifd">Mr. Pankaj Dubey is the Managing Director of Polaris India Pvt. Ltd., the Indian subsidiary of Polaris, world’s No.1 off-road vehicle company. Mr. Dubey joined Polaris India Pvt. Ltd. at the time of the company’s inception in January 2011.
                <br><br>
                Born in 1967 Mr. Dubey is a Postgraduate in Business Management, with an additional qualification in Program on Leading and Managing from the Indian Institute of Management, Kolkata. Mr. Dubey has an Economics background and attended Management Development Programmes at Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, The Indian school of Business, Hyderabad and Carlson School of Management, US.
                 <br><br>
                Exhibiting exemplary leadership in every task that he does, Mr. Dubey, believes in inculcating a healthy team spirit. His approach is people-oriented with core emphasis on teamwork. The records of accomplishment are testimonial to the motivation and support that Mr. Dubey extends to his teammates, dealers and employees.
                 <br><br>
                Mr. Dubey has contributed significantly to the growth of each organization he has worked with in the past as well.
                 <br><br>
                Prior to joining Polaris India Pvt. Ltd., Mr. Dubey has worked in India’s top automotive companies such as Yamaha Motors, LML, and Hero; which  have enriched him with diverse experience in the area of Sales, Marketing, Channel and Business Development. His last assignment was with Yamaha India Pvt. Ltd. as National Business Head.
                 <br><br>
                A man of substance, Mr. Dubey possesses the rare quality of turning negative in to positive. The best-recalled example could be when Mr. Dubey joined Yamaha, when the company was struggling to sustain itself in India. The Economic Times reported “Yamaha to Shut Shop”. However, believing in his capabilities and trusting his vision, Mr. Dubey made some significant strategy and also launched successful models like R15, Vmax, Fazer & FZ16. His ambitious efforts proved extremely useful in helping him maneuver the company towards profitability in a tightly contested and pressure-ridden field.  </p>
